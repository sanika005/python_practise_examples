1. What are class and instance attributes?
2. What are class and instance methods?
3. What type of access modifiers in python?
Ans. public,protected,private
4. What are the types of inheritance in Python and also explain it with example? 
Ans. single,multiple,multilevel,hierarchical.
5. What is super()__init__ in Python?
Ans. First super() function helps to access the immediate parent class's attributes. And super()__init__ call the parent class's __init__() method in the child class.
6. What are polymorphic function?
Ans. The function which accepts different type of arguments as an input. Ex: print() function.
7. What is the difference between Procedural Oriented Programming(POP) and Object Oriented Programmin(OOP)?
    Procedural Oriented Programming(POP)                                Object Oriented Programmin(OOP)
    - It deals with algorithms.                                             - It deals with data.
    - Programs are divided into functions.                                  - Programs are divided into objects.
    - Consume less memory.                                                  - Consume more memory.
    - Follows Top-Down approach.                                            - Follows Bottom-Up approach.
    - Not provides access specifiers.                                       - Provide as (public,protected,private)
    - Overloading not possible.                                             - Overloading is possible.
    - Less secure.                                                          - More secure.
    - Data hiding is not possible.                                          - Data hiding is possible.
    - ex:C,VB,BASIC                                                         - ex:Python,C++,Java

    1. Text type: str
    2. Numeric type: int,float,complex
    3. Sequence type: List,tuple,range
    4. Mapping type: dictionary
    5. Set type: set,frozenset
    6. Boolean type: bool
    7. Binary type: bytes,bytearray,memoryview
    8. None type: NoneType
